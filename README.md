# Sakila Sample Database Project

## About the Project

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis and exploration of the MySQL Sakila Sample Database. The Sakila database is a well-known sample database that is widely used for learning and demonstrating database design, SQL querying, and data modeling concepts. It simulates a DVD rental store using tables for films, actors, film-actor relationships, customers, inventory, rentals, and payments, among others.

Our project aims to provide insights into the movie rental business through various SQL queries, reports, and data visualizations. We explore trends, perform data aggregation, and offer recommendations to improve business strategies based on our findings.

## Features

- **SQL Queries:** A collection of SQL queries demonstrating basic to advanced SQL techniques, including joins, subqueries, unions, and aggregate functions.
- **Data Analysis:** Analysis of rental trends, customer behavior, and inventory management to derive actionable business insights.
- **Data Visualization:** Visual representations of key data points using libraries such as matplotlib, seaborn, or similar, to better understand trends and patterns.
- **Database Schema:** Documentation of the Sakila database schema, including entity-relationship diagrams and table descriptions.
- **Performance Optimization:** Examples of query optimization techniques and indexing to improve database performance.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- MySQL Server (5.7 or newer)
- Any SQL client tool (MySQL Workbench, DBeaver, etc.)
- Python (3.x) for data visualization scripts (optional)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/a-mamlouk/sakila-queries.git
   ```
2. Import the Sakila database into your MySQL server. Instructions and the database file can be found at the [MySQL website](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/sakila/en/).
3. Install any required Python libraries for data visualization (if applicable):
   ```
   pip install matplotlib seaborn pandas
   ```

## Usage

Navigate through the directories to find SQL scripts, analysis reports, and visualization scripts. Execute the SQL scripts within your SQL client connected to the Sakila database to explore various aspects of the database.

For running Python scripts, ensure you have a Python environment set up and the necessary libraries installed. Scripts can be executed from the command line or through an IDE.
